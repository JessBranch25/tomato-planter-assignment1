# ASSIGNMENT 1

Welcome to the CFG Java +Masters first assignment! 

Use this code as the starter code for your project (you do not have to, and you may edit it). 

Within `Main` you will find the code to start your app. This includes the code to interact with users, which you can edit and add to.  

Remember, you are not expected to write tests. 

## ⚠️ Please overwrite what is here in the README, so you can use it in your portfolio ⚠️
